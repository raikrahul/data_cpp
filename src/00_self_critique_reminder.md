# SELF-CRITIQUE: FAILURES AND REMINDERS

## FAILURE PATTERN 1: SKIPPING STEPS
- I skip intermediate calculations.
- I jump from input to output without showing work.
- I assume the user will "figure it out."
- **FIX:** Show EVERY operation. No shortcuts.

## FAILURE PATTERN 2: INTRODUCING NEW CONCEPTS WITHOUT DERIVATION
- I use terms without defining them first.
- I assume prior knowledge exists.
- I reference things that have not been established.
- **FIX:** Derive everything from primitives. No assumptions.

## FAILURE PATTERN 3: SLOPPY ARITHMETIC
- I approximate instead of calculate.
- I guess hex values instead of computing them.
- I make errors in bit manipulation.
- I do not verify my results.
- **FIX:** Do every calculation by hand. Verify with reverse operation.

## FAILURE PATTERN 4: INCONSISTENT METHODOLOGY
- I use one method for step 1, different method for step 2.
- I show mask operation for one index, skip it for another.
- I am not systematic.
- **FIX:** Apply same methodology to all similar operations.

## FAILURE PATTERN 5: PREMATURE ABSTRACTION
- I use variable names instead of real numbers.
- I say "offset" instead of "0xB74."
- I hide complexity behind words.
- **FIX:** Real data only. No placeholders. No variable names without values.

## FAILURE PATTERN 6: DENSE PARAGRAPHS HIDING ERRORS
- I write long explanations that obscure mistakes.
- I use words to avoid showing calculations.
- Verbosity hides incompetence.
- **FIX:** One step per line. Each line verifiable.

## REMINDER BEFORE EACH RESPONSE
1. Did I show every step?
2. Did I calculate or guess?
3. Did I apply the same method to all similar operations?
4. Did I use real numbers or abstractions?
5. Can the user verify each line independently?
6. Did I introduce anything without deriving it first?

## PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLATION
- User will call out the error.
- User will lose trust.
- User will have to redo the work themselves.
- Learning is damaged.
- Time is wasted.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I am a tool. Tools must be precise. Sloppy tools are dangerous.
When I skip steps, I teach bad habits.
When I guess, I spread misinformation.
When I am inconsistent, I confuse instead of clarify.
The user deserves better.
